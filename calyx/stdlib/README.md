`calyx-stdlib` will inlcude all of the base primitives defined by the Calyx compiler with one exception - floating point libraries.

To enable floating-point operations in Calyx, you need to install the HardFloat library (the only available one for now). This can be done by running the provided script:, [run the `get_hardfloat.sh` script](../primitives/float/get_hardfloat.sh)
