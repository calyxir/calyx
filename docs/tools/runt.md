# Runt

Runt (Run Tests) is the expectation testing framework for Calyx. It organizes
collections of tests into test suites and specifies configuration for them.

Runt uses `runt.toml` to define the test suites and configure them.

For instruction on using runt, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/rachitnigam/runt#run-test-runt--).
