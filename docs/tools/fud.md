# The FuTIL Driver

Working with FuTIL involves a lot of command-line tools. For example, an
incomplete yet daunting list of CLI tools used by FuTIL is:

- The Dahlia & the systolic array compilers
- FuTIL compiler and its various command line tools
- Verilator, the Verilog simulation framework used to test FuTIL-generated designs.
- Waveform viewers to see the results of simulation

`fud` aims to provide a simple interface for using these toolchains and
executing them in a pipeline.

The current documentation for fud lives [here](https://github.com/cucapra/futil/tree/master/fud#fud-futil-driver).
