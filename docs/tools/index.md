# Tools

Calyx uses an array of tools to simplify and streamline compiler testing,
development, and usage.

- [Fud: The Calyx Driver](../running-calyx/fud): Invoke various tools to compile, test, and simulation input programs.
- [Runt: Run Tests](./runt.md): Parallel expectation testing framework.
- [`exp` Generator](./exp-generator.md): Generates the necessary components to compute a fixed point `exp`.
