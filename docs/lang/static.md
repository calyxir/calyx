# Static Timing

By default, Calyx programs use a *latency-insensitive*, or *dynamic*, model of computation.
This means that the compiler does not know, track, or guarantee the number of cycles it takes to perform a computation or run a control operator.
This is in contrast to a *latency-sensitive*, or *static*, model of computation, where the number of cycles a component needs is known to, and honored by, the compiler.

In general, latency-insensitivity makes it easier to compose programs.
It grants the compiler freedom to schedule operators however it wants, as long as it meets the program's dataflow constraints.
It also prevents code from implicitly depending on the state of other code running in parallel.

However, there are two drawbacks to this approach.
First, the generated hardware may not be efficient: if the compiler does not know how long computations take, it must schedule them conservatively.
Second, it is impossible for *latency-insensitive* programs to interact with *latency-sensitive* hardware implemented in RTL;
this means that the use of black-box hardware designs requires costly handshaking logic at the interface.

To address these issues, Calyx provides a `static` qualifier that modifies components and groups, along with static variants of other control operators.

## Static Constructs in the Calyx IL

### Static Components

Say we have a multiplier component, `std_mult`, which multiplies the values `left` and `right` and puts the result in `out`.
Its latency is 3 cycles.
We can declare it as follows:
```
static<3> primitive std_mult[W](go: 1, left: W, right: W) -> (out: W);
```
Compare this to the divider component `std_div`, whose latency is unknown:
```
primitive std_div[W](go: 1, left: W, right: W) -> (out: W, done: 1)
```
The key differences are:
- The `static` qualifier is used to declare the component as static and to specify its latency.
- The `done` port is not present in the static component.

A client of the divider must pass two inputs, raise the `go` signal, and wait for the component itself to raise its `done` signal.
In contrast, a client of the multiplier must pass two inputs and raise the `go` signal, but it does not need to wait for the component to raise a `done` signal.
It can simply and safely assume that the result will be available after 3 cycles.


### Static Groups and Relative Timing Guards

Much like components, groups can be declared as static.
Since groups are just unordered sets of assignments, it pays to have a little more control over the scheduling of the assignments within a group.
To this end, static groups have a unique feature that ordinary dynamic groups do not: *relative timing guards*.

Consider this group, which performs `ans := 6 * 7`:
```
static<4> group mult_and_store {
  mult.left = %[0:3] ? 6;
  mult.right = %[0:3] ? 7;
  mult.go = %[0:3] ? 1;
  ans.in = %3 ? mult.out;
  ans.write_en = %3 ? 1;
}
```
The `static<4>` keyword specifies that the group should take 4 cycles to execute.

The first three assignments are guarded (using the standard `?` separator) by the relative timing guard `%[0:3]`.
In general, a relative timing guard `%[i:j]` is *true* in the half-open interval from cycle `i` to
cycle `j` of the groupâ€™s execution and *false* otherwise.

In our case, the first three assignments execute only in the first three cycles of the group's execution.
The guard `%3`, which we see thereafter, is syntactic sugar for `%[3:4]`.
We have used it in this case to ensure that the last two assignments execute only in the last cycle of the group's execution.


### Static Control Operators

Calyx provides static variants of each of its control operators.
While dynamic commands may contain both static and dynamic children, static commands must only have static children.

- `static seq` is a static version of `seq`; its latency is the sum of the latencies of its children.
- `static par` is a static version of `par`; its latency is the maximum of the latencies of its children.
- `static if` is a static version of `if`; its latency is the maximum of the latencies of its children.
- Calyx's `while` loop is unbouded, so it does not have a static variant.
- `static repeat` is a static version of `repeat`; its latency is the product of the number of iterations and the latency of its child.
- `static invoke` is a static version of `invoke`; its latency is the latency of the invoked cell.

## Guarantees

The `static` keyword is a promise to the compiler that the component or group will take exactly the specified number of cycles to execute.
The compiler is free to take advantage of this promise to generate more efficient hardware.
In return, the compiler must access out-ports of static components only after the specified number of cycles have passed, or risk receiving incorrect results.

There are other guarantees associated with individual static constructs:
- A child of `static seq` is guaranteed to begin executing exactly one cycle after the previous child has finished.
- All the children of a `static par` are guaranteed to begin executing at the same time.
- The body of a `static repeat` is guaranteed to begin executing exactly one cycle after the previous iteration has finished.
