# Undefined Behaviors

Undefined behavior in Calyx is either intentional or unintentional. This page tracks the various issues discussing the undefined behaviors that are known to currently exist in Calyx.

## Interface Signals

The `go` and `done` signals form the two core interface signals in Calyx. Their semantics are baked into the compiler and pervasively used to define the meaning of programs.

- [Isolation and stateful "doneness" (#651)](https://github.com/calyxir/calyx/discussions/651)
- [Well-formedness of `done` signals (#788)](https://github.com/calyxir/calyx/discussions/788)

## Undriven Ports

Calyx's continuous assignments do not make any static guarantees about which ports need to be driven when. Current efforts attempt to codify *when* reading from an undriven port is incorrect.

- [A few notes on undefinedness (#922)](https://github.com/calyxir/calyx/discussions/922)

## Semantics of `par`

`par` blocks in Calyx represent parallel execution of groups. Currently, there is no clear semantics for interactions between groups executing in parallel. The interpreter implements a form of lockstep semantics that disallows certain forms of concurrent reads and writes while the code generated by the compiler allows for arbitrary communication.

- [Formalizing the semantics of `par` (#932)](https://github.com/calyxir/calyx/discussions/932)

## Isolation Guarantees

Calyx groups have a strong isolation guarantee---they must execute for at least one cycle and guarantee that signals inside are not visible after they are done executing.
However, the isolation guarantees for combinational groups, continuous assignments, and `with` blocks is not clear.
