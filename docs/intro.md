# Getting Started

Calyx is an intermediate language and infrastructure for building compilers
that generate custom hardware accelerators.
These instructions will help you set up the Calyx compiler and associated
tools.
By the end, you should be able to compile and simulate hardware designs
generated by Calyx.

## Compiler Installation

Calyx is written in Rust. First, install [Rust][rust] (it should automatically install `cargo`).

### Using the Docker Container

The easiest way to get started is to use the [Calyx Docker container][calyx-docker] container that provides a pinned version of the compiler, all frontends, as well as configuration for tools.

The following commands will build the docker container for you and run it in an interactive shell:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/cucapra/calyx:latest
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/cucapra/calyx:latest
```

If you're using the container, skip to [Running Core Tests](#running-core-tests).

**Note**: The `--rm` flag will remove the container after you exit the shell. If you want to keep the container around, remove the flag.


### Install Crate

If you want just to play with the compiler, install the [`calyx` crate][calyx-crate]:
```
cargo install calyx
```
This will install the `calyx` binary which can optimize and compile Calyx programs. You will still need the [`primitives/core.futil`][core-lib] and [its accompanying Verilog file](https://github.com/cucapra/calyx/blob/master/primitives/core.sv) library to compile most programs.

### Installing from Source

Follow these instructions if you want to modify the compiler.


Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/cucapra/calyx.git
```
Then build the compiler:
```
cargo build
```

You can build and run the compiler with:
```
cargo build # Builds the compiler
./target/debug/calyx --help # Executes the compiler binary
```

## Running Core Tests

The core test suites tests the Calyx compiler passes.
Install the following tools for running the core tests:
  1. [runt][] hosts our testing infrastructure. Install with:
  `cargo install runt`
  2. [jq][] is a command-line JSON processor:
     * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install jq`
     * Mac: `brew install jq`
     * Other platforms: [JQ installation][jq-install]

Build the compiler:
```
cargo build
```
Then run the core tests with:
```
runt -i core
```

If everything has been installed correctly, this should not produce any failing
tests.

## Installing the Command-Line Driver

[The Calyx driver](./fud) wraps the various compiler frontends and
backends to simplify running Calyx programs.

Install [Flit][]:
```
pip3 install flit
```

Install `fud` (from the root of the repository):
```
flit -f fud/pyproject.toml install -s --deps production
```
Configure `fud`:
```
fud config --create global.root <full path to Calyx repository>
```
Check the `fud` configuration:
```
fud check
```

`fud` will report certain tools are not available. This is expected.

## Simulation

There are three ways to run Calyx programs:
[Verilator][], [Icarus Verilog][], and Calyx's native [interpreter][].
You'll want to set up at least one of these options so you can try out your code.

Icarus is an easy way to get started on most platforms.
On a Mac, you can install Icarus Verilog with [Homebrew][] by typing `brew install icarus-verilog`.
On Ubuntu, [install from source][icarus-install-source].
Then install the relevant [fud support][fud-icarus] by running:

    fud register icarus-verilog -p fud/icarus/icarus.py

Type `fud check` to make sure the new stage is working.
(Some missing tools are expected; just pay attention to the report for `stages.icarus-verilog.exec`.)

You can instead consider [setting up Verilator][fud-verilator] for faster long-running simulations or using the [interpreter][] to avoid RTL simulation altogether.

## Running a Hardware Design

We're all set to run a Calyx hardware design now. Run the following command:
```
fud e examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil \
  -s verilog.data examples/tutorial/data.json \
  --to dat --through icarus-verilog -v
```

(Change the last bit to `--through verilog` to use Verilator instead.)

This command will compile `examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil` to Verilog
using the Calyx compiler, simulate the design using the data in `examples/tutorial/data.json`, and generate a JSON representation of the
final memory state.

Congratulations! You've simulated your first hardware design with Calyx.
