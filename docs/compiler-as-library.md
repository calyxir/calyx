# The calyx Library

The implementation of the compiler separates the frontend from the internal data structures.
This allows developers to use the compiler as a library.
The `calyx` library exports all the data structures used by the compiler can be used to design new
tools that make use of Calyx.

See the [library documentation][source-doc] for an example of how to use the `calyx` library.
