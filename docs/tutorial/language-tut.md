# Calyx Language Tutorial

This tutorial will familiarize you with the Calyx language by writing a minimal program *by hand*.
Usually, Calyx code will be generated by a frontend.
However, by writing the program by hand, you can get familiar with all the
basic constructs you need to generate Calyx yourself!

Complete code for each example can be found in the [tutorial][] directory in
the Calyx repository.

## Get Started

The basic building block of Calyx programs is a *component* which corresponds
to hardware modules (or function definitions for the software-minded).

Here is an empty component definition for `main` along with an `import`
statement to import the standard library:

    import "primitives/core.futil";

    component main(@go go: 1) -> (@done done: 1) {
      cells {}
      wires {}
      control {}
    }

Put this in a fileâ€”you can call it `language-tutorial-mem.futil`, for example.
(The `futil` file extension comes from an old name for Calyx.)

You can think of a component as a unit of Calyx code roughly analogous to a function: it encapsulates a logical unit of hardware structures along with their control.
Every component definition has three sections:

* `cells`: The hardware subcomponents that make up this component.
* `wires`: A set of guarded connections between components, possibly organized into *groups*.
* `control`: The imperative program that defines the component's execution schedule: i.e., when each group executes.

We'll fill these sections up minimally in the next sections.


## A Memory Cell

Let's turn our skeleton into a tiny, nearly no-op Calyx program.
We'll start by adding a memory component to the cells:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-mem.futil:cells}}
```

This new line declares a new cell called `mem` and the primitive component `comb_mem_d1` represents a 1D memory.
You can see the definition of `comb_mem_d1`, and all the other standard components, in the `primitives/core.futil` library we imported.

This one has three parameters:
the data width (here, 32 bits),
the number of elements (just one),
and the width of the address port (one bit).

The `@external` syntax is an [extra bit of magic][ext-attr] that allows us
to read and write to the memory.

Next, we'll add some assignments to the `wires` section to update the value in
the memory.
Insert these lines to put a constant value into the memory:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-mem.futil:wires}}
```

These assignments refer to four *ports* on the memory component:
`addr0` (the address port),
`write_data` (the value we're putting into the memory),
`write_en` (the *write enable* signal, telling the memory that it's time to do a write), and
`done` (signals that the write was committed).
Constants like `32'd42` are Verilog-like literals that include the bit width (32), the base (`d` for decimal), and the value (42).

Assignments at the top level in the `wires` section, like these, are "continuous".
They always happen, without any need for `control` statements to orchestrate them.
We'll see later how to organize assignments into groups.

## Compile & Run

We can almost run this program!
But first, we need to provide it with data.
The Calyx infrastructure can [provide data to programs][data-format] from [JSON][] files.
So make a file called something like `data.json` containing something along these lines:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/data.json}}
```

The `mem` key means we're providing the initial value for our memory called `mem`.
We have one (unsigned integer) data element, and we indicate the bit width (32 bits).

If you want to see how this Calyx program compiles to Verilog, here's the [fud][] incantation you need:

    fud exec language-tutorial-mem.futil --to verilog

Not terribly interesting!
However, one nice thing you can do with programs is execute them.

To run our program using [Icarus Verilog][], do this:

    fud exec language-tutorial-mem.futil --to dat --through icarus-verilog \
        -s verilog.data data.json

Using `--to dat` asks fud to run the program, and the extra `-s verilog.data <filename>` argument tells it where to find the input data.
The `--through icarus-verilog` option tells fud which Verilog simulator to use (see [the chapter about fud][fud] for alternatives such as [Verilator][]).
Executing this program should print:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-mem.expect}}
```

Meaning that, after the program finished, the final value in our memory was 42.

> **Note**: Verilator may report a different cycle count compared to the one above. As long as the final value in memory is correct, this does not matter.

## Add Control

Let's change our program to use an execution schedule.
First, we're going to wrap all the assignments in the `wires` section into a
name *group*:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-control.futil:wires}}
```

We also need one extra line in the group: that assignment to `the_answer[done]`.
Here, we say that `the_answer`'s work is done once the update to `mem` has finished.
Calyx groups have *compilation holes* called `go` and `done` that the control program will use to orchestrate their execution.

The last thing we need is a control program.
Add one line to activate `the_answer` and then finish:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-control.futil:control}}
```

If you execute this program, it should do the same thing as the original group-free version: `mem` ends up with 42 in it.
But now we're controlling things with an execution schedule.

If you're curious to see how the Calyx compiler lowers this program to a Verilog-like structural form of Calyx, you can do this:

    fud exec language-tutorial-mem.futil --to calyx-lowered

Notably, you'll see `control {}` in the output, meaning that the compiler has eliminated all the control statements and replaced them with continuous assignments in `wires`.

## Add an Adder

The next step is to actually do some computation.
In this version of the program, we'll read a value from the memory, increment it, and store the updated value back to the memory.

First, we will add two components to the `cells` section:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-compute.futil:cells}}
```

We make a register `val` and an integer adder `add`, both configured to work on 32-bit values.

Next, we'll create three groups in the `wires` section for the three steps we want to run: read, increment, and write back to the memory.
Let's start with the last step, which looks pretty similar to our `the_answer` group from above, except that the value comes from the `val` register instead of a constant:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-compute.futil:write}}
```

Next, let's create a group `read` that moves the value from the memory to our register `val`:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-compute.futil:read}}
```

Here, we use the memory's `read_data` port to get the initial value out.

Finally, we need a third group to add and update the value in the register:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-compute.futil:upd}}
```

The `std_add` component from the standard library has two input ports, `left` and `right`, and a single output port, `out`, which we hook up to the register's `in` port.
This group adds a constant 4 to the register's value, updating it in place.
We can enable the `val` register with a constant 1 because the `std_add` component is *combinational*, meaning its results are ready "instantly" without the need to wait for a done signal.

We need to extend our control program to orchestrate the execution of the three groups.
We will need a `seq` statement to say we want to the three steps sequentially:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-compute.futil:control}}
```

Try running this program again.
The memory's initial value was 10, and its final value after execution should be 14.

## Iterate

Next, we'd like to run our little computation in a loop.
The idea is to use Calyx's `while` control construct, which works like this:

    while <value> with <group> {
      <body>
    }

A `while` loop runs the control statements in the body until `<value>`, which is some port on some component, becomes zero.
The `with <group>` bit means that we activate a given group in order to compute the condition value that determines whether the loop continues executing.

Let's run our memory-updating `seq` block in a while loop.
Change the control program to look like this:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil:control}}
```

This version uses `while`, the parallel composition construct `par`, and a few new groups we will need to define.
The idea is that we'll use a counter register to make this loop run a fixed number of times, like a `for` loop.
First, we have an outer `seq` that invokes an `init` group that we will write to set the counter to zero.
The `while` loop then uses a new group `cond`, and it will run while a signal `lt.out` remains nonzero: this signal will compute `counter < 8`.
The body of the loop runs our old `seq` block in parallel with a new `incr` group to increment the counter.

Let's add some cells to our component:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil:new_cells}}
```

We'll need a new register, an adder to do the incrementing, and a less-than comparator.

We can use these raw materials to build the new groups we need: `init`, `incr`, and `cond`.
First, the `init` group is pretty simple:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil:init}}
```

This group just writes a zero into the counter and signals that it's done.
Next, the `incr` group adds one to the value in `counter` using `add2`:

```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil:incr}}
```

And finally, `cond` uses our comparator `lt` to compute the signal we need for
our `while` loop. We use a `comb group` to denote that the assignments inside
the condition can be run combinationally:
```
{{#include ../../examples/tutorial/language-tutorial-iterate.futil:cond}}
```

By comparing with 8, we should now be running our loop body 8 times.

Try running this program again.
The output should be the result of adding 4 to the initial value 8 times, so 10 + 8 Ã— 4.
