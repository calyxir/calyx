    Elements are stored in buckets within which they are ordered by priority. For our implementation,

    At initialization we initialize `data` to be a list of empty buckets, each of which

    We store the number of elements that have already been inserted into the queue, initialized at 0.
    With each iteration, we increment this.

    When inserting elements into the queue, we pass in this parameter along with the specified rank,
    so that it is factored into a modified rank calculation that removes all ties between ranks.
    (See PIEO documentation for details of this modified rank calculation.)

    When asked to push:
    - We compute the bucket to push to as the rank of the new element multiplied by bucket width,
    wrapped around to be within the size of the queue.
    - We then insert said new element into its assigned bucket such that the rank order is preserved.

    When asked to pop:
    - If the length of `data` is 0, we raise an error .
    - Otherwise, we pop the lowest-rank element in the queue.

class StrictPifo:
    """
    This is a version of a PIFO generalized to `n` flows, with a strict policy.
    Flows have a strict order of priority, which determines popping
    order. If the highest priority flow is silent when it is its turn, that flow
    simply skips its turn and the next flow is offered service. If a higher
    priority flow get pushed to in the interim, the next call to pop will
    return from that flow.

    Supports the operations `push`, and `pop`.
    It takes in a list `boundaries` that must be of length `n`, using which the
    client can divide the incoming traffic into `n` flows.
    For example, if n = 3 and the client passes boundaries [133, 266, 400],
    packets will be divided into three flows: [0, 133], [134, 266], [267, 400].

    It takes a list `order` that must be of length `n`, which specifies the order
    of priority of the flows. For example, if n = 3 and the client passes order
    [1, 2, 0], flow 1 (packets in range [134, 266]) is first priority, flow 2
    (packets in range [267, 400]) is second priority, and flow 0 (packets in range
    [0, 133]) is last priority. The argument `subqueues` is a list of subqueues,
    which can be any type of queue from this module.

    - At push, we check the `boundaries` list to determine which flow to push to.
    Take the boundaries example given earlier, [133, 266, 400].
    If we push the value 89, it will end up in flow 0 because 89 <= 133,
    and 305 would end up in flow 2 since 266 <= 305 <= 400.
    - Pop first tries to pop from `order[0]`. If this succeeds, great. If it fails,
    it tries `order[1]`, etc.
