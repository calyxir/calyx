    """Inserts the component `stable_binheap` into the program.

    It is a minimum binary heap that breaks ties via insertion order. That is, if
    two elements with the same rank are inserted, the element that was inserted
    first is the one that gets popped first.

    It has:
    - three inputs, `cmd`, `value`, and `rank`.
        - `cmd` has width 1.
        - `rank` has width 32.
        - `value` has width 32.
    - one memory, `mem`, of size `2**queue_size_factor`.
    - two ref registers, `ans` and `err`.
        - `ans` has width 32.
        - `err` has width 1.

    We use `below`, a binary heap that accepts 64-bit ranks
    and 32-bit values, and counter `i`.
    - To push a pair `(r, v)`, we push `(r << 32 + i, v)` to `below` and increment `i`.
    - To pop, we pop `below`.

    If we push `(r, v)` and then later `(r, v')`, we know `v` will be popped before `v'`
    since it is pushed with higher rank to `below`.
