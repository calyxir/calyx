    It is a first in, first out queue implemented via binary heap.

    It has:
    - two inputs, `cmd` and `value`.
        - `cmd` has width 1.
        - `value` has width 32.
    - one memory, `mem`, of size `2**queue_size_factor`.
    - two ref registers, `ans` and `err`.
        - `ans` has width 32.
        - `err` has width 1.

    We use `stable_binheap`, a binary heap that resolves ties based on insertion order.
    That is, If two elements with the same rank are inserted,
    the element that was inserted first is the one that gets popped first.

    Hence, we insert all elements with the same rank into `stable_binheap`, as our
    tie-breaking mechanism ensures FIFO order.
