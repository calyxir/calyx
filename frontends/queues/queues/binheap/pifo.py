    """Inserts the component `pifo` into the program.

    It is a two-flow, round-robin queue implemented via binary heap.

    It has:
    - two inputs, `cmd` and `value`.
        - `cmd` has width 1.
        - `value` has width 32.
    - one memory, `mem`, of size `2**queue_size_factor`.
    - two ref registers, `ans` and `err`.
        - `ans` has width 32.
        - `err` has width 1.

    Call our flows A and B, represented by 0 and 1 respectively.
    When popping, we pop one value from A, one from B, and so on.
    If one class is silent and the other is active, we pop from the active class
    in FIFO order until the silent class starts up again. The erstwhile silent class
    does not get any form of "credit" for the time it was silent.

    We use `binheap`, a stable binary heap, rank pointers `r_a` and `r_b`, and a 1-bit
    signal `turn`. The pointers `r_a` and `r_b` represent the rank assigned to the
    next pushed value from flows A and B respectively. The signal `turn` stores
    which flow's turn it is.
    - `turn` is initialized to 0 (i.e. flow A).
    - `r_a` is initialized to 0.
    - `r_b` is initialized to 1.
    - To push value `v_a` (resp. `v_b`) from flow A (resp. B),
        - we push `(r_a, v_a)` (resp. `(r_b, v_b)`) to `binheap`.
        - Then, `r_a += 2` (resp. `r_b += 2`).
    - To pop, we pop `binheap`; say we obtain `v`.
        - if the flow `v` belongs to matches `turn`, switch `turn` to the other flow.
        - Otherwise, if `v` belongs to flow A (resp. B), `r_b += 2` (resp. `r_a += 2`).

    This mechanism for moving `r_a` and `r_b` ensures flows A and B are
    interleaved correctly.
