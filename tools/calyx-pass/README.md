# calyx-pass

`calyx-pass` (name TBD) is a work-in-progress *pass transformation* explorer for calyx.
You give it an input file and some options, and you can explore how passes transform the file over time.

![Example running of the tool](example_v0.0.0.png)

> Above: Running v0.0.0 on [test.futil](test.futil).

## Features

- Visualize pass transformations with readable diff insertions. By default, it uses `-p all`, but you can provide a different alias.
- Focus on changes localized to one specific component with the `-c` option.
- Set a breakpoint for pass exploration with the `-b` option. You can then use `u` to undo previous passes and explore the changes before and after the pass. Pass passes with `-d` to be skipped before the breakpoint.
- Nearly-arbitrary pass execution with TUI commands. Currently `a`/`s`/`u` (accept/skip/undo) are supported, and `r` (run given pass) is [planned](TODO.md).
- And all those unchecked in [TODO.md](TODO.md) are coming soon!
