The numbers in the domination map refer to the BEGIN_ID, END_ID, and NODE_ID attributes 
that are attached to each non-empty control statement when the domination map is built. 
To see which ID's refer to which control statement, look at the Calyx Program, which should 
be printed along with the map when it is printed.
