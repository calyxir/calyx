# Fused Temporal Intermediate Language (FuTIL)
An intermediate language for [Dahlia][].

Calyx is the name of the visitor framework for FuTIL.

### Installation
- Install [Rust][rust].

The core compiler can be built and installed with:
- Run `cargo build` to download all dependencies and build calyx.
- Run `./target/debug/calyx --help` to get options from the calyx binary.

We are using [runt][] for testing. Install it with:
- Install [runt][] by running `cargo install runt`.
- Run `runt` to run tests.

For Verilator testing, install:
- [verilator][]
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install verilator`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install verilator`
  - Mac: `brew install verilator`
  - If none of these work for you, I defer you to the official Verilator install
  instructions: [https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing][]
- [vcdump][] by running `cargo install vcdump`
- [jq][]
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install jq`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install jq`
  - Mac: `brew install jq`
  - If none of these work, [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) are the official install directions.

### Compiler Development

The compiler source lives under [calyx/src](calyx/src). While changing the compiler,
use `cargo run -- <calyx options>` to rebuild the compiler and run files
at the same time.

**Primitives Library**: FuTIL can use customizable libraries based on the
backend. The libraries live under [primitives](primitives). You probably want
to use `primitives/std/lib` with the `-l` flag.

```bash
cargo run -- examples/simple.futil -l primitives/std.lib
```

**Debug mode**: The `-d` flag shows the FuTIL program after running a pass.
Use this to debug outputs from passes.

The general flow of the compiler is as follows:
 1) Build up `context::Context`
    - Parse FuTIL files + library file specified in CLI.
    - Build an in memory representation of each Component specified using
      the primitives defined in the library file to resolve and instantiate
      subcomponents defined with `new-std` statements.
 2) Run passes that update the context. Passes are defined using the Visitor
    framework defined in `src/passes/visitor.rs`. For now the passes to run are
    just specified in `src/main.rs`
 3) Use a backend to emit code from the context. Backends must implement
    `backend::traits::Backend`.

We use the [structopt][] library to
implement the command line interface.

### Writing a Verilator test
The `tests/verilog` folder is dedicated to Verilator correctness testing.
A `.futil` in this directory defines a new test. To get output we run the following steps:
 - Use `verilog` backend to generate a Verilog file
 - Run Verilator using `sim/testbench.cpp` as the testbench. 
   - This expects a toplevel component in Futil named `main`
   - We drive the `main` component by pulsing the `clk` port on `main`
   - We simulate until the `ready` port on `main` is high.
 - Convert the generated `vcd` file to `json`
 - Use `{filename}.jq` to choose a subset of signals to test
 - Compare this generated file to `{filename.expect}`
 
Concretely, the things to do to create a new test are:
 - make a new `{filename}.futil` file
 - make a `{filename}.jq` file to select the signals you are interested in testing.
 **Note**: This file can be blank, but needs to exist.
 - make a `{filename}.expect` file with the values that you expect to see

## Makefile
`make [filename].futil`: Generate Futil program from Dahlia program. It
requires to install [Dahlia][] first.

`make [filename].v`: Generate Verilog RTL file from Futil program.

`make [filename].vcd`: Generate vcd file from Verilog RTL file. One can use ventilator to visualize it.

`make [filename].json`: Generate a json representation of the simulated Verilog file.

`make [filename].res`: Use `[filename].jq` to refine `[filename].json` to subset of signals.

`make clean`: Deletes all generated files.
