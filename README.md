</p>
</h1>

Calyx is an intermediate language and infrastructure for building compilers that generate custom hardware accelerators. 

See the [Calyx website](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/calyx), [language documentation](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/docs/calyx/) and the [documentation for the source code](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/docs/calyx/source/calyx) for more information. Calyx's design is based on [our paper](https://rachitnigam.com/files/pubs/calyx.pdf).
