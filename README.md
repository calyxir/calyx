# Fused Temporal Intermediate Language (FuTIL)
An intermediate language for [Dahlia][].

Calyx is the name of the visitor framework for FuTIL.

### Installation
- Install [Rust][rust].
- Install [runt][] by running `cargo install runt`.
- Run `cargo build` to download all dependencies and build calyx.
- Run `runt` to run tests.
- Run `./target/debug/calyx --help` to get options from the calyx binary.

### Compiler Development

The compiler source lives under [calyx/src](calyx/src). While changing the compiler,
use `cargo run -- <calyx options>` to rebuild the compiler and run files
at the same time.

**Primitives Library**: FuTIL can use customizable libraries based on the
backend. The libraries live under [primitives](primitives). You probably want
to use `primitives/std/lib` with the `-l` flag.

```bash
cargo run -- examples/simple.futil -l primitives/std.lib
```

**Debug mode**: The `-d` flag shows the FuTIL program after running a pass.
Use this to debug outputs from passes.

The general flow of the compiler is as follows:
 1) Build up `context::Context`
    - Parse FuTIL files + library file specified in CLI.
    - Build an in memory representation of each Component specified using
      the primitives defined in the library file to resolve and instantiate
      subcomponents defined with `new-std` statements.
 2) Run passes that update the context. Passes are defined using the Visitor
    framework defined in `src/passes/visitor.rs`. For now the passes to run are
    just specified in `src/main.rs`
 3) Use a backend to emit code from the context. Backends must implement
    `backend::traits::Backend`.

We use the [structopt][] library to
implement the command line interface.

## Makefile

`make [filename].futil`: Generate Futil program from Dahlia program. It
requires to install [Dahlia][] first.

`make [filename].v`: Generate Verilog RTL file from Futil program.

`make [filename].vcd`: Generate vcd file from Verilog RTL file. One can use ventilator to visualize it.

`make clean`: Deletes all generated files.
