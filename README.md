# Calyx: A Compiler Infrastructure for Accelerator Generators

Calyx is an intermediate language and infrastructure for building compilers that generate custom hardware accelerators. It is based on [our paper](https://rachitnigam.com/files/pubs/calyx.pdf).

See the [Calyx documentation](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/calyx/) and the [documentation for the source code](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/calyx/doc/calyx).
