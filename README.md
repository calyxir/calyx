A Compiler Infrastructure for Accelerator Generators
</p>
</h1>

Calyx is an intermediate language and infrastructure for building compilers that generate custom hardware accelerators. It is based on [our paper](https://rachitnigam.com/files/pubs/calyx.pdf).

See the [Calyx documentation](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/docs/calyx/) and the [documentation for the source code](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/docs/calyx/source/calyx).
