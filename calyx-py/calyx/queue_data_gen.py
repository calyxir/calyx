    - The `commands` memory has `num_cmds` items, which are 0 or 1 for both work-conserving and

    FOR WORK-CONSERVING POLICIES
        0 : pop

        0 : pop by predicate

    then items are chosen from 0 and 2 using a helper.

    If the `nwc` flag is set to False (marking the policy as work-conserving),
    then the predicate is treated as though always true.

    - The `values` memory has `num_cmds` items:
    random values between 0 and 400.
    - The `ranks` memory has `num_cmds` items:
    random values between 0 and 400.
    - The `times` memory has `num_cmds` items:
    random values between 0 and 50.
    - The `ans_mem` memory has `num_cmds` items, all zeroes.
