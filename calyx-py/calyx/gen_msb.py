    """
    Generates Calyx component to produce the following:
    For a given fixed point number x>=1, we want to select the largest n such
    that 2^n <= x. Note that this is essentially finding the index of the most
    significant bit in x. count_ans is the value for `n`, and `value_ans` is the
    value for `2^n`.
    Essentially, the component uses a while loop, a counter register, and shifts the input
    1 bit to the right at each iteration until it equals 0.
    Important note: this component doesn't work when the input is 0.
