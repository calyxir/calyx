    It is a minimum binary heap, represented as an array.

    It follows the interface of the `pifo` component:
    It has inputs:
    - `cmd`: tells us what operation to execute.
    The heap supports the operations `pop`, `peek`, and `push`.
    - `value`: the value to push to the queue.
    - `rank`: the rank with which to push the value.

    If an answer is expected, it is written to the `ans` register.
    If an error occurs, the `err` register is set to 1.
